# Dream Radar Cart Redirect

This patch now supports Pokemon Transporter!

Dream Radar is a game which allows getting level 5 legendary Pokemon in dream balls with hidden abilities, and sending them to a Black 2 or White 2 NDS cartridge. Pokemon Transporter allows transferring Pokemon from previous games to newer games.

This patch redirects saving from an NDS cartridge to a file on the SD card. Using this patch allows dream radar and transporter to use saves from [TWiLightMenu](https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/TWiLightMenu) and [nds-bootstrap](https://github.com/ahezard/nds-bootstrap).

## Usage

This requires having [Luma3DS](https://github.com/AuroraWright/Luma3DS) on your 3DS.

1. Download and unzip the zip file from the latest releases
   - The zip will have two folders in it - `radar` and `transporter`
   - Each folder will have two ips patches in it - `black2.ips` and `white2.ips`
2. Copy the ips patch you want to your sd card
   - For Pokemon Dream Radar use `/luma/titles/00040000000AE100/code.ips`
   - For Pokemon Transporter use `/luma/titles/00040000000C9C00/code.ips`
3. Ensure you have a save file at `/roms/nds/saves/white2.sav` or `/roms/nds/saves/black2.sav`
   - If you're using [TWiLightMenu](https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/TWiLightMenu), this means having a game at `/roms/nds/white2.nds` or `/roms/nds/black2.nds`
4. Ensure that game patching is enabled
   - You can enable it in the Luma3DS configuration menu by holding the Select button before starting the console.

## Building the patches for custom save paths

If you want a different game Id or save path, you can use the `poke_redirect.py` script to build the patches yourself. Run `python poke_redirect.py -h` to see information on how to build the patches.

Alternatively, use the `*.s` files to build the patches from scratch.
